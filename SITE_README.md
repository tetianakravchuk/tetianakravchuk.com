## Flashcard Study Lab

The Data Science page now includes an interactive flashcard feature at:

`pages/data-science.html#flashcards`

What it supports:

- Built-in decks for ML basics, evaluation, NLP & embeddings, QA for ML, and World Publishing Houses applications.
- Flip-card interaction, next/previous navigation, shuffle, category filter, and local progress.
- A browser form for adding custom cards. These custom cards are saved with local storage on the current device.
- To make a card permanent for every visitor, add it to the `baseFlashcards` array in `assets/script.js`.

### Visual memory cues

Each built-in flashcard now supports:

- `visualKey` — chooses a small built-in mini diagram, such as `supervised`, `split`, `folds`, `rmse`, `mae`, `r2`, `embedding`, `classification`, `qa-gates`, `edge-cases`, `entity-resolution`, or `human-review`.
- `memoryHook` — a short “picture this” sentence that helps trigger visual memory before the answer is shown.

Custom cards added in the browser also include a visual memory cue field. Permanent public custom diagrams can be added by extending the `visualTemplates` object in `assets/script.js`.
